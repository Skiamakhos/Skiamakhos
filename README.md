- 👋 Hi, I’m @Skiamakhos. 
- 👀 I’m interested in back end programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Clojure, and Spring/Spring Boot. Actually been working on a Spring web app for about 7 years but I suck at coding interviews so I'm trying to build a portfolio of stuff I'm doing on courses. Ever notice how no coding test ever seems to be anything like what you do 90% of the time as a jobbing developer? 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything interesting. I've been using Java for years so I guess I could be useful for that.
- 📫 How to reach me - HMU on Twitter, same handle.
